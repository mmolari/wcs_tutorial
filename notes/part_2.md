# using pangraph to estimate private sequence

In the previous tutorial we identified a clade with high structural similarity in the region surrounding the beta-lactamase gene.

In this second part of the tutorial we build a pangenome graph containing 10 whole chromosomes of isolates from a part of the tree that includes this clade. We then use this graph to measure how much of accessory genome is not shared for any given pair of isolates.
